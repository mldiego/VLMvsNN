1. **Identify the digits and operators in each image.**  You'll have to manually look at each image and transcribe what it shows.
2. **Construct the arithmetic expression.**  Put the digits and operators together in the order they appear in the image sequence.
3. **Evaluate the expression using left-to-right order of operations.**  Remember that in this case, you are NOT following standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).  Calculate from left to right.
4. **Format your answer.**  Write the complete expression and its result in the format `<expression>=<result>`.


For example, if after looking at the images you determine the sequence is 2 + 3 * 4 - 1, the calculation would be:

2 + 3 = 5
5 * 4 = 20
20 - 1 = 19

The final output should be: `2+3*4-1=19`
